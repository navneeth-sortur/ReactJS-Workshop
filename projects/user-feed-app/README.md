# User Feed with Infinite Scroll & Shimmer Loading

A simple React-based user feed application that fetches random user profiles from the **Random User API** and displays them in responsive Bootstrap cards.  
This project includes a **production-quality infinite scroll feature** powered by the Intersection Observer API, allowing more users to load automatically as you scroll.

To enhance the user experience, the project also implements **Shimmer skeleton loaders** for both the initial load and subsequent page loads, creating a smooth and modern feel.

### **Tech Stack**

- **React** (Hooks-based architecture)
- **Axios** for API requests
- **Bootstrap** for layout & styling
- **Intersection Observer API** for infinite scroll
- **Custom Hooks** (`useInfiniteScroll`)
- **CSS Shimmer Skeleton Loaders**

A lightweight and modern mini-project to understand infinite scrolling, API pagination, custom hooks, and clean UI loading states in React.
